# Hello-World

Hi i am trying to teach myself C# by building a complete application part by part, so i can understand it better, dont like reading all the technical stuff to begin with, i prefer to dive straight in then come back to the technical stuff which then makes more sence practically, i have no intension of making a career out of it just a usefull tool as an extra for work should i need it
